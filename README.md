`DeepCellMap` is a Python package containing methods for analyzing the spatial distribution of cells in tissues (histological images and fluorescence images). DeepCellMap consists of various independent modules enabling cell detection and classification, segmentation of anatomical regions, analysis of cell-cell and cell-region couplings, as well as analysis of the distribution of cell populations in clusters and the interactions between clusters of different populations.


# How tu use DeepCellMap ? 

The notebooks provided in `./DeepCellMap_V2_general_use/` offer a step-by-step guidance for users (with a minimum of Python experience) in using DeepCellMap with any dataset. In addition to the explanations provided in the notebooks, the user can consult the documentation in `./docs`, where the following documents can be found: 

-  `Application of DeepCellMap to a new Dataset.pdf`
- `ConfigFile_explanation_(1_dataset__1_Config_file).pdf` and 
- `DeepCellMap_files_overview_.pdf`

Brief explanation of each notebook: 

1. **`DeepCellMap_1_image_preprocessing.ipynb`** performs image downscaling, tissue mask extraction and tiling 
2. **`DeepCellMap_2_laboratory_Tissue_segmentation.ipynb`** (optional) : helps to find good method to segment tissue of the entire image 
3. **`DeepCellMap_3_laboratory_Cell_segmentation.ipynb`** (optional) :  helps to find good method to segment cells in tissue
4. **`DeepCellMap_4_cell_classification.ipynb`** (optional) : is used to classify cells using a deep learning based model after cell detection and segmentation 
5. **`DeepCellMap_5_application_DeepCellMap.ipynb`** enables the application of DeepCellMap on entire images or ROI in images. 



**Note: the code is regularly updated to make it easy to use in a wide range of contexts. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us: theo.perochon@hotmail.fr**
